This project was developed using Perforce.

## Group project
This game is the end result of a group project in DAE, we were with 7 students: 3 programmers, 3 artists and 1 sound designer.
I was responsible for a part of the programming.

I programmed:

The player camera system\
The Poison floor\
The ball shooting machine\
Talking head robot\
Player cosmetic addons\
Moving actors around the scene\
Character animation blueprint\
Cinematics\
Making frequent builds for windows and mac\




This was made in UE 5.2 and we only used C++ for the gameplay logic. It was prototyped, designed and developed and polished in 12 weeks.
