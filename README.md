## My Machine
This project was made in collaboration with MyMachine Vlaanderen: https://www.mymachinevlaanderen.be \
MyMachine is an organization that links elementary school students with high school/university students to create projects.\
In our case we got linked with a class of 16 kids around 9 years old. And we were given the task of making a game that includes all their "Dream machines".\
We visited the class a couple times, first for collecting their dream machine ideas, and then we went back for playtesting.\
In the end we managed to make a game that includes every machine, whilst also keeping it simple and playable for 9-year-olds that aren't used to gaming.



## Group project
This game is the end result of a group project in DAE, where we were 7 students: 3 programmers, 3 artists, and 1 sound designer.
I was responsible for a part of the programming.

I programmed:

- The player camera system
- The Poison floor
- The ball shooting machine
- Talking head robot
- Player cosmetic addons
- Moving actors around the scene
- Character animation blueprint
- Cinematics
- Making frequent builds for Windows and Mac

This project was developed using Perforce as version control system.

This was made in UE 5.2 and we only used C++ for the gameplay logic. It was prototyped, designed and developed and polished in 12 weeks.
